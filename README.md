Reflectly is an app that enables users to track their mental health

Background and Information 

As a signed in user, you may: 
*record your moods in a private diary, including reflections. 
*post your diaries to a public community, or keep these private. 
*interact with other diaries and post comments. 

If you are not signed in, you may still view the community page, however you cannot make any diary entries. 

Technologies Used: 
*MONGO DB
*Express.js
*React
*Node.js

Next Steps: 
*As a stretch project, we'd look to have an additional model for 'Moods'. 
*Users would be able to add their own moods and keep these as a log within their account.
